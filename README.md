# Automating Sheets using an ESP32
This repository is an archive of some automation projects I've done for sheets. 

Google sheets, Excel/Libreoffice sheets, all included, with automations done using different methods.

All codes written in Micropython were done using Thonny IDE. Any code written in Wiring (C++) was done using Arduino IDE.

The ESP32 model used for all programs is ESP32-WROOM-32 unless stated otherwise.
The operational system in which I wrote all the codes in was Linux Mint unless stated otherwise.
