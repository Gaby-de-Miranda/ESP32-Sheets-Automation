# ESP32-projects
This repository serves mostly as an archive of some interesting automation projects I've made using the microcontroller ESP32.

All the codes written in Micropython were done on Thonny IDE. 

For convenience purposes, the projects that are heavily reliant on visuals will have a commented link to their own simulation on wokwi.com
